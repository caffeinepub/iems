  "summary": "Diff adds core PWA assets (manifest, service worker, offline fallback page) and introduces an in-app AppInfo dialog in the main layout to show/copy the app URL and guide installation. However, the URL being copied/displayed appears to be only the origin (not the full current URL), and the required image assets themselves are not shown as added in the diff summary. There is also a notifications panel/toggle added to the layout that is not part of the BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "UI shows the current app URL (derived from window.location) in a readable, copyable form, and “Copy link” copies the full URL.",
      "reason": "AppInfoDialog uses window.location.origin, which omits the path/query/hash and therefore does not represent the full current URL.",
